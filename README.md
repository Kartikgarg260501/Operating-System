# Operating-System
During my academic and personal projects, I extensively worked on implementing and analyzing various page replacement algorithms in operating systems. These projects honed my understanding of memory management and the intricate balance between performance and resource utilization in modern computing environments.
Page Replacement Algorithms used : 1. FIFO 
2.LRU(Least Recently Used)

Algorithms Implemented:

FIFO Algorithm:
Description: The FIFO algorithm evicts the oldest page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded.

LRU Algorithm:
Description: The LRU algorithm evicts the least recently used page to make space for a new page.
